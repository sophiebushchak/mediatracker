# Media Tracker

## Project Information
This application is a media tracker made in Next.js, the goal is to create an application that is able to track different 
types of media for a user, with accounts, a user profile and overview, and searching functionality to add media someone is 
currently experiencing in one big engagement portfolio.

Currently the data is entirely sourced from an old txt file in which I tracked my own media. This has been previously converted
to JSON, which the application is using as its temporary data. The goal is to create an accompanying back-end in the future
and further define datatypes, as well as create a search that will connect to the back-end which is then further connected
to free media web apis, such as TMDB.

## Current Progress
Currently, a list of media can be displayed and the user can navigate to the specific lists of various media types. Basic 
sorting has been implemented as well as some styling. This application has no interactivity yet.
